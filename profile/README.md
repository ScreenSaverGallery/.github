## ü¶ß About
ScreenSaverGallery is a project that merges the worlds of digital art and screen savers. Our aim is to breathe new life into the screensaver medium by turning it into a dynamic canvas for contemporary art. The screensaver showcases artworks that either act as screen savers or thematize virtual space, networking, and digital interaction. It is not just a platform for presenting art but also an experimental environment for its development.

Artworks in the ScreenSaverGallery are curated to add a new dimension by placing them in the context of a screensaver. Curators, artists, researchers and developers are invited to explore and experiment with the possibilities offered by this medium.

## üêä History
ScreenSaverGallery was first launched by artists Barbora Trnkova and Tomas Javurek in 2012 as an artistic, somewhat ironic, project. In 2013, together with artist and curator c-merry and curator Sakrowski, we started a continuous exhibition program that continues to this day. You can see the list of screensavers (shows) [here](https://screensaver.gallery/archive/screensavers). ScreenSaverGallery is hosted on [metazoa.org](https://metazoa.org) servers.
